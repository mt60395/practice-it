// Write code that uses a for loop to print each element of an array named data that contains five integers.
// Once your code works for the array of size 5, generalize the code so that it works for an array of any length.

for (int i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    printf("element [%d] is %d\n", i, data[i]);
